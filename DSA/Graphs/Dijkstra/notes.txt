Aim. 

1. Find the shortest distance from a given node to every other node similarily like Bellman_Ford.
2. SSSPP - Single Source Shortest Path Problem.

Process.

1. Basic process -> Mark - Relax - choose - Mark - relax - choose.

Mark - Current set of minimum distance nodes from source.
Relax - Relax all connected nodes with newly marked vertices.
Choose - Choose the lowest distance node from newly marked vertex and Mark it.

Requirements - 

1. dist[] - stores distance of every vertex from source node and dist[s] = 0
2. mark[] - stores the current set of nodes that are 100% shortest distance from source.
