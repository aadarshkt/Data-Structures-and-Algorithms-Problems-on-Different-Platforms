Problem with arrays.
 * size is fixed and preallocated.
 * worst case insertion is 0(n) even with vector because once size increases more than n all elements are to be copied.
 * insertion and deletion at the middle or beginning is very costly.
 * implementation of queue and deque is hard with arrays.
 * insert and delete with linked list is very easy.
 * elements do not have to be at contiguous locations.

Advantages and disadvantages of circular linked list.
 * we can insert at the end and beginning can be done in O(1) time just by maintaining one tail.
 * to print circular linked list use do while loop.
 * 

Advantages of circular doubly linked list.
 * We can get the last node in constant time.
 * Use do while loop to print the loop.
