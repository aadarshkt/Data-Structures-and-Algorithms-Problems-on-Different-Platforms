example of stable sorting algorthm - bubble sort, insertion sort, Merge sort.
example of stable sorting algorthm - Selection sort, quick sort, heap sort.

c++ stl sort(arr, arr+n) does sorting in O(nlogn)

Stable sorting means if two elements are intially sorted then their original position in the array will be not be changed.

1.Selection sort
  * Does less memory writes
  * Basic idea for heap sort.
  * Not stable 
  * Not requires extra memory space for sorting.(In place)(No auxiliary space)
  * O(n^2)

2.Insertion sort
  * O(n^2) worst and O(n) best
  * In-place and stable
  * For small arrays.
  * basically u pick a element and place it to it's correct position.

3.Merge sort
 * Divide, conquer and Merge.
 * stable.
 * O(nlogn) time and O(n) space.(not in place.)
 * but best in time is quicksort.
 * used in external sorting.(means parts can be sorted independently)
 * well suited for linked lists works in O(1) space.
 * for arrays quicksort is best and for linkedlist mergesort.
 * python uses timsort which is variation of mergesort and insertion sort.

4.Quick sort
 * not stable.
 * divide and conquer algorthrithm
 * worst case O(n2);
 * 0(n) space. and best space 0(logn)
 * faster
 * tail recursive.
 * average case O(nlogn).
 * partition function is used.
 * hoare's partition is the most easy to understand and fastest.
 * use mergesort when stablity is required and quick sort when it is not required.
